                <p>We are Oxford Academy STEM, an on campus club and academic team. We aim to support the bright young minds of the students within our school. Our goal for students is simple: Learn, compete, and thrive. Members of OA STEM participate in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math competitions, ranging from trivia to constructing robots. Even if you don't feel ready for competition, we welcome students without any prior experience--education is our number one priority. You can join one...two...or all four of our departments!</p>

                <h1>SCIENCE</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The Science Department provides students opportunities to expand their knowledge of the sciences and investigate the natural world, through a variety of projects, activities, and competitions. The various events that are held throughout the year, such as the middle school division Science Bowl, the high school division Science Bowl, and the annual regional Science Olympiad, further student learning and produce a competitive environment that fosters learning. By placing the necessary resources in the hands of members, Science gives students an avenue through which they are able to understand the importance of science in the context of other academic fields, as well as the major role science has in our daily lives.</p>
                <p>Science selects a group of students to represent Oxford Academy at the annual Science Bowl, all of whom will compete with other schools in subject areas that include physical science, life science, mathematics, energy, general science, earth science, space science, and chemistry. Moreover, students prepare for the Science Olympiad that takes place later on in the year, a competition that consists of many small events which incorporate many of the same disciplines as those seen in Science Bowl. As a department, our main focus is ensuring the success of our members both in and out of the classroom. In all, Science’s lead science scholars are well-educated on an extensive span of scientific disciplines and are dedicated to making sure that students are able to perform at their best, cultivating those who will come to be the leading members of our department in years to come.</p>

                <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The technology department will cover the topics of Java, robotics, Android app development, networking, and HTML this summer. For those who have programming experience, we will be preparing you for upcoming Java competitions such as Progfest and CodeQuest. Our department is no stranger to winning and will be training you for success. </p>
                <p>We will be mainly focusing on teaching the basics of Java programming to beginning students and preparing advanced students for the local programming competitions. In the years past, our department has placed 1st and 4th in the local Troy Competition as well as 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place in CSULA's Progfest.
New for this year, advanced students will have the opportunity to learn how to develop mobile apps for Android devices. In addition to Java programming, our department will be teaching students how to build their own websites with the HTML language.</p>
                <p>Students in our department will also learn the basis of computing for robots to compete in VEX and FRC, globally renowned robotics competitions. They will be given the task of programming the robot and will essentially be the drivers behind the robot. Students will work alongside instructors from NASA and Boeing as well as students from the engineering department all the while gaining invaluable experience.
The technology department is looking to expanding its horizons past just programming this summer. We are planning to cover the topic of networking, studying the interaction between computers and the web. Students will learn about the communication processes among devices in a network.</p><p>
No prior knowledge is needed for our sessions besides an interest in technology and an open mind.</p>

                <h1>ENGINEERING</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The Engineering Department gives students the best opportunity to finally put all of their logic and knowledge to work, creating amazing robots to compete against other schools all throughout Southern California and the rest of the US. We have two main competitions: VEX and FRC, both of which require students to quickly design, build, and learn to drive a robot to efficiently finish the required tasks. With the help of mentors and a lack of restrictions, students can really spread their wings in terms of creative problem solving, getting firsthand experience on what real engineers do in the field every day. </p>
<p>STEM Engineering is as real as it gets, using power tools, CAD, and of course the power of teamwork to build robots from scratch. It takes a real team of members to build a competent robot, and in our department we want as many people involved as possible. Our mentors and other senior members will teach the basics of managing parts and tools starting in the summer, instilling those key habits for the build seasons. And, the rewards are immense, with huge trophies and widespread attention, along with a chance to travel to huge arenas for final competitions.</p>
<p>FRC is our main competition, and although it only has an actual 6 week build season, we prepare all year for. We compete against the top teams in Southern California, all of which are vying for a position at Finals. Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re going to be elitist like some of these other teams. We accept anyone who is willing to work as a part of our team. </p>
<p>Engineers are the true solvers of the world’s biggest problems. "I don’t spend time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems." –Elon Musk</p>

                <h1>MATH</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Come out to summer STEM Mathematics! This summer, we will have two main focuses: school math and competition math. We invite anyone interested in reviewing content taught in school math classes or preparing for on-site and online math competitions to join our department.
For those of you who would like to get a head start on your math class for the 2016-2017 school year, the tutoring leads will be providing introductory material and an opportunity to prepare for these classes. Alternatively, if you would like to reinforce your knowledge on a math class that you already took in the past year, you can do that as well – tutoring leads will be able to help review the material and focus on specific weak areas. Tutoring and assistance for school math classes will continue throughout the school year.</p>
<p>In addition, regardless of experience level, everyone will have the opportunity to participate in team and individual practices for various math competitions or to learn competition math through topic-specific exercises and guidance from the competitions lead. We will also be discussing competition opportunities throughout the year, including the American Math Competitions (AMCs), the largest national math contest for high school students, and local events such as Caltech Harvey Mudd Math Competition (CHMMC), and potentially forming teams for them.</p>

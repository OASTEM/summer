Our goal for students is simple: Learn, compete, and thrive. Members of OA STEM participate in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math competitions, ranging from trivia to constructing robots. Even if you don't feel ready for competition, we welcome students without any prior experience--education is our number one priority. You can join one...two...or all four of our departments!</p>

                <h1>SCIENCE</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The Science Department is devoted to providing students opportunities to expand their knowledge of the sciences and investigate the natural world, through a variety of projects, activities, and competitions. Students are given an environment in which they are able to cultivate and pursue their interest in different areas of science and explore a variety of career options and skill sets that can be available to them in this growing field. By placing the resources necessary in the hands of members, not only are students able to understand the importance of science in conjunction with other academic fields, but also how science plays a part in their lives and the world that we live in.</p>
                <p>A major aspect of the competitive learning environment that Science creates is based on the various events that are held throughout the year: the middle school division Science Bowl, the high school division Science Bowl, and the annual regional Science Olympiad. In the Science Bowl events, a select group of students are chosen to represent Oxford Academy in competing with other schools in subject areas that include physical science, life science, mathematics, energy, general science, and earth and space science, as well as chemistry exclusively for the high school division.</p>
                <p>In a similar fashion, the Science Olympiad focuses on many of the same disciplines, with some engineering influence as well, and consists of a large variety of events and small competitions that incorporate a large span of science, taking from a vast amount of relevant scientific information. As a department, our main focus is ensuring the success of our members both in and out of the classroom. Our lead science scholars are well-educated on an extensive span of scientific disciplines and are dedicated to making sure that students are able to perform at their best, cultivating those who will come to be the leading members of our department in years to come.</p>

                <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The technology department will cover the topics of Java, robotics, Android app development, networking, and HTML this summer. For those who have programming experience, we will be preparing you for upcoming Java competitions such as Progfest and CodeQuest. Our department is no stranger to winning and will be training you for success. </p>
                <p>We will be mainly focusing on teaching the basics of Java programming to beginning students and preparing advanced students for the local programming competitions. In the years past, our department has placed 1st and 4th in the local Troy Competition as well as 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place in CSULA's Progfest.
New for this year, advanced students will have the opportunity to learn how to develop mobile apps for Android devices. In addition to Java programming, our department will be teaching students how to build their own websites with the HTML language.</p>
                <p>Students in our department will also learn the basis of computing for robots to compete in VEX and FRC, globally renowned robotics competitions. They will be given the task of programming the robot and will essentially be the drivers behind the robot. Students will work alongside instructors from NASA and Boeing as well as students from the engineering department all the while gaining invaluable experience.
The technology department is looking to expanding its horizons past just programming this summer. We are planning to cover the topic of networking, studying the interaction between computers and the web. Students will learn about the communication processes among devices in a network.</p><p>
No prior knowledge is needed for our sessions besides an interest in technology and an open mind.</p>

                <h1>ENGINEERING</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>In STEM Engineering, we primarily design and control robotic systems to compete in various competitions throughout the year. We compete in two main competitions: First Robotics Competition (FRC) and VEX Robotics Competition. We have done very well considering the size and limitations of our department in the past few years, and we are striving to go even further in the coming year. Thankfully, we get to work with various engineers from NASA along with prominent Technology Companies such as Siemens, all of whom have had years of experience applying their knowledge of engineering into real world solutions.</p>
<p>STEM Engineering is as real as it gets, using power tools, CAD, and of course the power of teamwork to build robots from scratch. It takes a real team of members to build a competent robot, and in our department we want as many people involved as possible. Our mentors and other senior members will teach the basics of managing parts and tools starting in the summer, instilling those key habits for the build seasons. And, the rewards are immense, with huge trophies and widespread attention, along with a chance to travel to huge arenas for final competitions.</p>
<p>    FRC is our main competition, and although it only has an actual 6 week build season, we prepare all year for. We compete against the top teams in Southern California, all of which are vying for a position at Finals. Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re going to be elitist like some of these other teams. We accept anyone who is willing to work as a part of our team.</p>
<p>Engineers are the true solvers of the world’s biggest problems. “I don’t spend time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems.” –Elon Musk</p>

                <h1>MATH</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Come out to summer STEM Mathematics, which will be from June 13 to July 30 on Tuesdays from 9-12 pm! This summer, we will have two main focuses: school math and competition math.</p>
<p>For those of you who would like to get a head start on your math class for the 2016-2017 school year, the tutoring leads will be providing introductory material and an opportunity to prepare for these classes. This may be particularly helpful for people taking an AP course, and tutoring leads will be able to provide guidance on how to most effectively prepare for the exam, what review books to use, and more. Alternatively, if you would like to reinforce your knowledge on a math class that you already took in the past year, you can do that as well – tutoring leads will be able to help review the material and focus on specific weak areas. Tutoring and assistance for school math classes will continue throughout the school year.</p>
<p>Whether you have competed in math competitions before or are simply interested in math subjects not taught in school, you can also take part in competition math practices and preparation! People of all levels of experience will have the option to participate in team and individual practices for various math competitions, including AMC 10/12, National Internet Math Olympiad (NIMO), and past tests from local competitions, or to reinforce their knowledge of competition math through topic-specific exercises and guidance from the competitions lead. We will also be discussing competition opportunities throughout the year and potentially forming teams for them.
Through summer STEM, the Math Department hopes to provide a wide variety of opportunities for everyone! Please email math@oastem.org if you have any questions.</p>
